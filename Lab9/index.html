		<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The challenges for Lab9 is to modify the CSS properties of elements. It is pretty new to us to do the CSS in JavaScript.
</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We faced some problems while trying to bring up the work to the webpage, we first couldnt define the new elements, so we added a "constant" in front of our new elements, then we made use of init method, and we make sure that we used innerhtml to print them out on the page!</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We solved all the challenges and problems. Here is the program execution! We also made another function that links the button to a page explaining how good garlic chip is!</p>
