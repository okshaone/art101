		<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>As this lab turned out to be an easier lab out of the ones we have done, we did not face too many challenges while doing it, we believe not facing any challenges demonstrates the skills we've learned throughout the class.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The one problem we had while working on this project is how to add a div id="output" to our html file, took us a while to research on this bonus step working on this lab</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You can see the result in console log, or HERE!</p>
