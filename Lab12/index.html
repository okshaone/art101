		<h1>Lab 12 - Conditions</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>For this specific lab, we went smooth and we did not face any challenges at all until we started to working on step X. the foundations were easy to understand and the tasks are straight forward. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We faced some problems trying to figure out how to add the second event in order to display the description of the specific house assigned with the button, then we soon realize that we could literally just fit the that move in the same founction where it returns the house, all we had to do is just to append the specific new texts according to the result with if-statements.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You can enter your name below to see which house you are asigned to, and you can even see the description to the specific house!</p>
