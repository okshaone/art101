		<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>When we were trying to do the StepX, the picture of comics should showed up one at a time; however, they all showed up together. After doing research online, we found the solution, which is making another function inside of the jquery function.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>When we first started to do the comicobject.alt, we didnâ€™t have the order right for single and double quotation marks in the function, which caused a problem of not showing the information of each comic.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here we have all the comics. Please click Next or Previous to view them.</p>
