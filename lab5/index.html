		<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<h2>Challeneges</h2>
		<p>We both came in java with little to no knowledge in java script, since java classes was no longer offered at UCSC, therefore it is really challenging for us to do the lab with, not to mention that we are still new with html and .css as well, but we did managed to have the work done in an exceptional amount of time thanks to our patience while coding.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The most difficult problem we faced while doing this lab is to debug after we linked the java script files to html file, a lot of things went missing because of our inexperience in java, so we spent a lot of time debugging to make the file work properly.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We defeated every problems and challenges through our teamwork. Here is the program execution.</P>
