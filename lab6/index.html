		<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<h2>Challeneges</h2>
		<p>While we first started to work on this Lab, it was really hard for us to understand what document.writeln() really does instead of a system.out(println), and when we were creating the object, we were having difficulties understand its function.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The main problem we got happened in the debugging process, we were missing tons of commas which made the entire code not work at all, after we fixed that, we then faced the problem to make sure the script output is presented in the right way.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We defeated every problems and challenges through our teamwork. Here is the program execution.</P>
