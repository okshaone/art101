		<h1>Welcome to My Homepage!</h1>
		<p>Hello guys! My name is Stephen, and I love three things. I love video games so much that I have to be playing it while doing this assignment. I love ribs so much that I'm smoking my ribs over apple wood while doing this assignment. I love sleeping so much that I'm sleeping while doing this assignment.</p>
