        <h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
        <p>The idea of this lab is for us to learn how to manage local file stractures , add images into index.html files, and upload with GitHub Desktop.</p>
        <h2>Challenegs</h2>
        <p>It took me so much time to figure out how to link the images into index.html files. I am pretty new to html and css, so I have to be extra patient to code.</P>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Here's the index.html file I created based on the knowledge we learned.</p>
