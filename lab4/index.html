	 <h1>Challenge</h1>
	  <p>We had a huge misunderstood with the instructions for this lab, as we were thinking that making the step1 and 2 "outlines" was intended as a command for codes, so we spent roughly an hour figuring it out.</p>

	 <h1>Problems</h1>
	  <p>We had problems that occurred once we try to fit the java scripts into the index HTML files, but thanks to the example it was provided in the instructions, we eventually figured it out.</p>

	 <h1>Results</h1>
					Pseudocode an everyday task<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Graduate from UCSC<br>
			 		1.Gets a good GPA<br>
 		 	 		2.Finish GEs<br>
 		 	 		3.Have enough units<br>
 		 	<li>Not get pulled by police
 			<li>Get drunk in the dorm
 			<li>Eating 5 loaves of bread in one meal
		</ul>
					Pseudocode a computer task<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating a BlackJack simulator
		</ul>

		<pre><code>
//Refresh the data and start from (3) if any line is printed.<br>
//Print "You Win" when SumValue == 21<br>
//Print "You Lose" when SumValue > 21<br>
//Give the player 2 random values, each between 1-10<br>
//Having the option for the player to choose rather than get another value or not, go to (6) if yes, and (7) if not.<br>
//Calculate the sum of values the player holds, if the sum is -< 20, repeat (5).<br>
//Pick a random value between 2-20, if  < SumValue, print "You Win"; if == SumValue, print "Tie".<br>
    </pre></code>
