		<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We spent almost 5 hours to do this lab as this is one of the most challenging lab weâ€™ve faced, we first ran into some troubles trying to have the button connected to a function that links it to a eventlistener, then we tried various ways to change the sortname function  so that it automatically links with the input (user-name)</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The biggest problem we faced was to connect the functions together as we borrowed the sortname function from lab 7, we made so many changes but we forgot that we did not need the alert and window.promt, eventually we worked it out and we made sure the code ran smoothly with 3 functions total.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>TRY TO PUT YOUR NAME IN THE TEXT INPUT BELOW, WE WILL RE-CREATE IT TO GOD LEVEL AND RETURN IT BACK TO YOU IN THE EMTY BOX BELOW!! also, do not click the other button, I've warned you! </p>
		<input type="text" id="user-name">
		<button id="my-button">"Input your name: "</button>
		<button id="my-button2">"Click here if you like your new name, turn off your device if you don't!"</button>
