			<h1>Lab 11 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
	<div id= 'challenge'>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>It's really interesting how jquery works, the we faced some challenges while trying to find the right command with creating a button and adding toggle to "click". But we figured it out by doing tons of research online. We also did not realize we have to do a ready function before the entire thing.</p>
  </div>

  <div id= 'problems'>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The main problem we had was the most frustrated one we've ever faced. As we have another language setted in our windows system, we typed quotation marks in chinese, making the entire code not working at all. We've tried to debug so many times but no error is showing up in console, but the code just won't run, eventually we made it happen by redo the code again and compare the code.</p>
  </div>

  <div id= 'results'>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You can now click on the 3 buttons (challenge, problems, and results) to make the texts blue for each individual division, and you can also click on the two buttons below to CHASE THE BLUE.</p>
