    <h2>Challenges No.1</h2>
		<p>The challenge  I (Stephen) had while answering the question on stack overflow is to whether he should write the entire code for the person or not,  I then decided to point out the fact that the number of ids Array is not accurate as the id starts from "0", and explain to the person that he needs to update his list before he prints it in console log!</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Here's Stephen's answer post on stackflow with the original question!</p>
