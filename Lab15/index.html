		<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We faced some challenge while trying to figure out what ID and Key is in the data section, then we soon realized that there was no need for them from our specific API. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The one problem we faced was how to display the NASA's picture of the day, we solved it by adding allow cors on our google chrome extension.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here's the result, press activate to get a fortune cookie and pree nasa to see NASA's picture of the day</p>
    <button id="activate"> Activate </button>
    <br>
    <div id = "output"></div>
    <br>
    <button id="nasa"> Nasa Picture of the Day! </button>
    <br>
    <div id = "output2"></div>
